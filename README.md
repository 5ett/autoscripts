# myphonescripts
mostly scripts to automate certain "pain in the neck" tasks

The boring explanations of the mucky code i put in this repository

• For Dispatch.py
a simple script to quickly sort out my videos, docs and images in the download folder into desired directories on my phone(would work for pc too). Personally, I don't like it when my download folder is filled with a mixed filw types. Besides apks, .txt files and that one env doc, I like that folder cleaned out all the time. So I wrote this script to quickly do all the sorting and the moving.

If you do want to use it too, you should copy the script into the folder you'd like to clear out. You'd also need a python app. I recommend pydroid  (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3) if you're using mobile.
you would have to replace all destination directories for the different file types as they may differ from mine


small steps.
